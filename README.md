# Using a CNN deep learning model to build a flower classifier

I use a few hundred images of flowers, commonly found during Spring in New England, to train a CNN classifier. All the 
training dataset images were sourced before March 2019. To test the app, please upload an image that is of a more recent
vintage.

Currently the model can identify the following flowers: 
1. Aster
2. Black Eyed Susan
3. Helenium 
4. Hemerocallis
5. Japanese Anemone
6. Monarda
7. Sunflower
8. Toad Lily.

If the test image is not from this set of flowers, it will unfortunately still classify it as one. 

As they say: Sometimes wrong, but never in doubt.
