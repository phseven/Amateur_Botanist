# Using a CNN deep learning model to build a flower classifier

I use a few hundred images of flowers, commonly found during Spring in New England, to train a CNN classifier. 

Currently the model can identify the following flowers: Aster, Black Eyed Susan, Helenium, Hemerocallis, Japanese Anemone, Monarda, Sunflower and Toad Lily. If the test image is not from this set of flowers, it will unfortunately still classify it as one. 

As they say: Sometimes wrong, but never in doubt.
